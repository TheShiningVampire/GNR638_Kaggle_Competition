## About <a name = "about"></a>

The repository contains codes written for the Kaggle competition as a part of course GNR 638: Machine Learning for Remote Sensing in Semester 7 at IIT Bombay. The task for the competition was to perform image classification on the image dataset provided. The Deep Learning models were to be written from scratch and no transfer learning was to be used.

## Models Used

For the classification task I have implemented the following models:
 - Inception net
 - EfficientNet

For the final submission Inception net was used.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

All the codes have been written in Python 3.7. Pytorch and torchvision are required to run the codes.  
To run the Jupyter notebook, first clone the repository using the following command:  
<code>
 git clone https://github.com/TheShiningVampire/GNR638_Kaggle_Competition.git
</code>
## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Just open the CNN_train.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the code. To run a particular cell in the Jupyter notebook, just click on the cell and then press the run button or press shift+enter.
